# Traffic Security

# Aim of the project:
The project was aimed to modernize the highway system by implementing the following steps:
## 1. Vehicles classification and traffic frequency:
To classify the vehicles and provide the traffic frequency by obtaining individual vehicle counts over a period, which can be used for the road survey, automatic toll collection etc.
## 2. Vehicle tracking:
To provide vehicle location at a point of time by capturing vehicle image, licence plate image and slight details i.e., driving direction, unique ID number, capturing date and time, which can be used for effective tracking.
## 3. Saftey measures:
By categorizing the vehicles based on the provided flagged licence plates into suspicious and normal. The CSV file contains all the vehicle details including its licence plate number in text format and whether the vehicle is flagged (suspicious or not) for further preprocessing.
